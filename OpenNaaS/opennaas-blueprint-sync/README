Project to reproduce error exporting WS trough DOSGI after activating blueprint sync mode.


Project is based on two main bundles. 

- Sync Blueprint Bundle: declare two services (serviceA and serviceB) that are exported by dOSGi through a RESTful WS.
- Sync Blueprint Feature: declate all dependencies to be installed in karaf in order to boot the Sync Blueprint bundle.


Requirements
------------

- Apache Servicemix 4.5.2 


Steps
-----

1) Compile the whole project

	$ mvn install

2) Edit karaf features of servicemix distribution (etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg) to only boot following featuers on startup.

	featuresBoot=config,ssh,management

3) Edit etc/config.properties file to activate blueprint sync mode.

	org.apache.aries.blueprint.synchronous=true

4) Start karaf and add the new repo to install the bundle

	$ bin/karaf
	
	karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.opennaas/org.opennaas.sync.blueprint.features/1.0.0/xml/features

	karaf@root> features:install opennaas-sync-blueprint

5) Check that the services are exported via WS in following URLs

	http://localhost:[port_number]/opennaas/serviceA?_wadl
	http://localhost:[port_number]/opennaas/serviceA?_wadl


Error appears intermittently, so if both of them are exported, reboot karaf until you see one of them fails.
